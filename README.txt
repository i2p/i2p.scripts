This branch contains scripts useful to developers.
Feel free to improve them and add new ones.

Most of these scripts need the environment variable $I2P set to the
i2p install directory.

Many of the scripts require naming lookups, which require hosts.txt
(or a symbolic link) to be in the current working directory.

All scripts are public domain unless otherwise specified.

Note that many CLI tools are now a part of the I2P releases.
Run one of the following commands to see the available tools:

- java -jar i2p.jar
- java -jar router.jar
- java -jar routerconsole.jar
- java -jar i2psnark.jar
