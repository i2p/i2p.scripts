Git sync scripts
================

These are some simple, reasonably-stable scripts for syncing between
gitlab and github. They need to be run by an SSH user with permission
to use the repository on both services. It can otherwise be run without
logging into the Github or Gitlab API's.

To use it, run:

        ./run.sh

To run it in the background, run:

        ./background.sh
