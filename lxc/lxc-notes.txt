Hardware requirements: 16GB works fine for 16 containers so far


chmod 755 .local .local/share
mkdir .local/share/lxc

sudo adduser --uid=101000 --gid=101000 lxcuser
sudo addgroup --gid=101000 lxcgroup
sudo adduser zzz lxcgroup


Doesn't work - systemd ignores system ulimits:
increase open files in /etc/security/limits.conf
Does work:
Add the following to /etc/systemd/system.conf and /etc/systemd/user.conf
DefaultLimitNOFILE=32768:524288


/etc/sysctl.conf
fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1024
or sudo echo 1024 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
default 128 is not enough



No reseeder code or container needed!



Create container i2p1
Start container i2p1: lxcstart 1
Get a shell in i2p1: lxca 1
In container i2p1:
apt install openjdk-15-jre-headless
install i2p created from ant installer-linux: java -jar i2pinstall... -console
don't run i2p yet!!!
copy the defaultrouter.config to /home/ubuntu/i2p in the container
now clone container 1 to containers 2-16 with lxc-copy
now start all containers with lxcstart
now start i2p for the first time in all containers with lxcstarti2p
wait a couple of minutes for all the routers to create RIs
run lxcfloodri to flood the RIs from each router to all the others
wait a couple of minutes for all the routers to load the flooded RIs
they should now be talking to each other
